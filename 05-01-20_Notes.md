- [Portfolio](http://localhost:5000/#), I've added new media there from Undraw.

Should I focus on data visualizations or more on document formats. These may seem like two seperate topics, but many media I've found that does data viz, also uses some powerful formatting engine under the hood.

Which research Avenue is best?
1. Problem - Solution
1. Design or Re design
2. Literature review

- Transitioning from covid specific to data visualizations
  - Jupyter notebook
  - Google colab. See [visuals activity](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1s4D3mrx5sUo-1PIRtlUW6u0zv6sbqT6y)
  - Numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib
  - Frontend visualizations - higcharts and the like.
  
 ## Data visualizations I've seen about COVID
- https://covid19.pink/
- [AAtishb, seen on minutephysics](https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/)


## What format makes the most sense for my report to take?
- Word/Google/ normal document for normal report
- Latex - see [out.pdf](https://github.com/jdeweese1/ENGL_415_Final_Report/out.pdf) - although the autobibliography did not work
- Jupyter notebook/Google Colab
- Web page/markdown document
